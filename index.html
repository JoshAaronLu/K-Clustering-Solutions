  <h1 id="intro">A Visual Exploration of K-Centered Clustering Algorithms</h1>
  <h2 id="intro"> - Optimizing After-School Program Locations across the U.S</h2>
  <h3>by Josh Lu, Johann Paul, and Bhuvan Devasru</h3>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>
      <b>Given a set of cities, if you could only build a handful of hospitals across all of them, where would you choose to build them?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    This question is a common example of the K-Center clustering problem, 
    a classic mathematical problem studied in computer science in which one 
    aims to pick the k best centers, given a set of points to choose from. 
  </p>

<p>
    Other real-world examples include building distribution warehouses for supply networks, 
    clustering for machine learning purposes, or, as demonstrated in this article, building 
    after school programs in public schools.
  </p>

This page, contains a series of interactive visualizations 
intended to help users understand and compare five different approaches to the K-Centered problem, 
using data of public school locations across the U.S. taken from the 
National Center for Education Statistics'
<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/geographic/schoollocations">2023-2024 Public Schools & School Districts</a>  
data set as our locations. 

  </div>
  <h2>Optimization Criteria: K-Means v.s. K centers</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    Given our problem, there are different ways we could approach the solution.

    <p>
    Do we want to pick our centers such that the average distance from a 
    point to it’s closest center is minimized? This is the <b>K-Means</b> approach.
    </p>    

    <p>
    Or, do we want to pick our centers such that the maximum distance 
    of any given point is minimized (e.g. no city is more than 1 hour 
    away from a hospital)? This is the <b>K-centered</b> approach.
    </p>    

    This decision will change the criteria on which we optimize when designing an algorithm.
    
  </div>
  <h2>The Naive Solution</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>The most obvious approach to any problem is brute force. 
      For K-centered clustering, this means trying every possible combination and picking the best one.
      While brute-forcing will get you an optimal solution it is oftentimes too inefficient in practice.</p>
  
      <p><b>Brute force approach (K-Centers)</b>
 <ol> 
  <li>Generate all possible combinations of K centers from our set of points</li>
  <li>Go through each combination, compute the max distance from each point to its nearest center</li>
  <li>Keep track of combination with the smallest “worst-case” distance</li>
 </ol>
      
        
        This is extremely inefficient as the number of points grows, and is only feasible for tiny data sets. Below, we’ve modeled the naive K-Centers algorithm on a small subset of the U.S. public schools. For each step, we’ve drawn a line highlighting the “worst-case” max distance point-center pair.

  <h2>Naive K-Means </h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>
      The Naive approach to K-Means is similar to the naive K-Centers approach, but instead
      of optimizing for the best "worst-case" distance, we optimize for 
      the best average (squared) distance for each point to its nearest center.

  <h2>Prolems with the Naive Algorithms</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>When visualizing these algorithms, we only used a tiny subset (less than fifty)
       of the hundred thousand public schools in the United States.
      It is nearly impossible to run these algorithms on a data-set as large as the schools. 
      While these algorithms can get you the optimal solution, 
      their runtimes are incredibly inefficient. 
      In particular both of these algorithms run in \(\mathcal{O}(2^{n})\) time. 
      We can’t use these algorithms on large examples as their time complexities 
      blow up way too quickly. Hence, for us to succeed in solving what we set 
      across to do, we must come up with more efficient algorithms. 
</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Approximation Algorithms</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>It turns out that while computing an optimal solution for these problems takes 
      exponential time, we can construct very accurate solutions 
      that give us a certain approximation factor in polynomial time. 
      We will discuss approximation algorithms for both k-means and k-center, 
      that work within a realistic time complexity.

    <h2>Lloyd’s Algorithm</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
    
    <p>Lloyd’s algorithm fails to provide a guaranteed approximation factor, 
      however, for the vast majority of instances it provides a near optimal 
      solution in \(\mathcal{O}(n^{3})\) time. 
      These are the steps: <ol><li>Choose k centers at random
</li><li>In each cluster compute the average of all the coordinates, that is, compute the centroid of each cluster. Make the point that is closest to this centroid as the new center. 
</li><li>Repeat step 2, until convergence. </li></ol></p>

   <!-- 3) Gonzalez’s k-Centers -->
   <h2>Gonzalez's Algorithm</h2>
   <div class="info-box">
    <p>Gonzalez's algorithm is a greedy approximation algorithm to the k-centers problem. It achieves a 2x approximation, which means that if the optimal solution produces a radius of R, it returns an optimal radius of at most 2R. The algorithm follows the following steps: <ol><li>Choose the first center at random
</li><li>Find the point that is furthest away from its closest center among all points, and make   it a new center.</li><li>Choose every consequent center using the criteria established in step 2, and repeat until you have k-centers.
</li></ol></p>
